# MEV Redistribution Hook for Uniswap v4

Welcome to the **MEV Redistribution Hook** repository! This project introduces an innovative Uniswap v4 hook designed to capture and redistribute **Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)** profits directly to **Liquidity Providers (LPs)**, fostering a fairer and more equitable **DeFi ecosystem**.

---

## üåü Project Overview

In decentralized finance (DeFi), **MEV** represents profits extracted by reordering, inserting, or censoring transactions within a block. Traditionally, these profits are captured by miners, validators, or searchers, leaving liquidity providers (LPs)‚Äîthe backbone of protocols like Uniswap‚Äîout of the equation.

Our **Uniswap v4 Hook** changes this paradigm by:

- Capturing MEV profits generated within the protocol.
- Redistributing these profits directly to liquidity providers.
- Ensuring a more balanced and fair distribution of value.

This solution boosts LP returns, enhances protocol incentives, and contributes to a healthier DeFi ecosystem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **MEV Capture:** Systematically detects and captures MEV opportunities in Uniswap v4 pools.
- **Profit Redistribution:** Automatically allocates MEV gains proportionally to LPs based on their liquidity share.
- **Seamless Integration:** Designed to integrate smoothly with Uniswap v4, requiring minimal configuration.
- **Transparency and Fairness:** Ensures LPs are rewarded for their contributions without compromising the protocol's integrity.
